# üîä Voice Sound Calculator Project

This project contains two different calculator implementations with **voice sound effects** that speak the button names!

## üéµ Voice Sound Features

### Each Button Speaks Its Name:
- **Numbers (0-9)**: Each number has a unique voice pattern
  - "Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"
- **Operators**: Each operator has its own voice
  - "Plus", "Minus", "Multiply", "Divide", "Percent"
- **Special Buttons**:
  - "Equals" - Success voice pattern
  - "Clear" - Warning voice pattern
  - "Delete" - Deletion voice pattern
  - "Decimal" - Decimal point voice pattern
  - "Goodbye" - Farewell voice pattern

### Voice Pattern Technology:
- **Java Version**: Uses frequency sequences to simulate speech patterns
- **Web Version**: Uses Web Audio API with multiple oscillators for voice synthesis
- **Realistic Timing**: Pauses between syllables for natural speech flow

## üìÅ Files in this Project

- `SoundCalculator.java` - Java console calculator with voice patterns
- `SoundCalculator.html` - Web calculator with Web Audio API voice synthesis
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## üñ•Ô∏è Java Voice Calculator (`SoundCalculator.java`)

A command-line calculator that speaks button names using synthesized voice patterns.

### Features:
- ‚úÖ **Voice feedback** for every input - buttons speak their names!
- ‚úÖ **Frequency sequences** to simulate speech patterns
- ‚úÖ All basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- ‚úÖ Error handling with error voice patterns
- ‚úÖ Interactive console interface
- ‚úÖ Different voice patterns for different actions

### How to Run:

#### Prerequisites:
1. **Install Java JDK** (if not already installed):
   - Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/)
   - Install and add to PATH

#### Steps:
1. **Compile the Java file:**
   ```bash
   javac SoundCalculator.java
   ```

2. **Run the calculator:**
   ```bash
   java SoundCalculator
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** and hear the voice sounds!

### Example Usage:
```
=== Voice Sound Calculator ===
Each button press will speak its name!
Available operations: +, -, *, /, %

Enter first number: 5
[Plays "Five" voice pattern]
Enter operation (+, -, *, /, %): +
[Plays "Plus" voice pattern]
Enter second number: 3
[Plays "Three" voice pattern]
Result: 5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
[Plays "Equals" voice pattern]
```
